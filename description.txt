V1 of the models uses attention weights to determine node significance when the model predicts dementia.
V2 of the models uses GNNExplainer to identify node importance for the dementia class (or subgraph which would be like brain region)

Predicted nodes or subgraphs could be localized back to cortical surfaces, indicating affected brain regions
but this could be unreliable since LORETA may not be super accurate and EEG channel location may be enough
